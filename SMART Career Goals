Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 years):

In the next 1–2 years, my goal is to finish my studies with CodeSpace and build a strong portfolio as a UI/UX designer or web developer. I’ll measure my progress by completing projects that showcase both my design and coding skills. This goal is achievable since I already have experience creating websites and enjoy designing logical, user-friendly interfaces. It’s relevant because it directly supports my passion for creating visually appealing, functional digital experiences. I aim to secure a full-time role in this field within two years of completing my program

Long-term Goals (3-5 years and beyond):

In the next 3–5 years, my goal is to become a specialist in my field, whether in web or blockchain development and be recognized for my expertise. I also hope to give back by mentoring or teaching younger developers part-time, as I’m passionate about youth empowerment and knowledge sharing. Using the skills and experience I gain, I want to create sustainable tech solutions that support disadvantaged communities. This aligns with my interests in innovation, problem-solving, and making technology accessible to everyone.
