Anticipated Challenges:

Challenge I face is trying to do too many things at once and not always balancing my time well. To manage this, I’ll create a realistic work schedule to stay organized and meet deadlines. Another challenge is that I’m past the typical “youth” age group, which makes it harder to access certain internships and entry level opportunities. To overcome that, I’ll focus on building strong skills and a solid portfolio that helps me stand out based on ability, not age

Opportunities for Growth:

I study alot so I'm building strong technical skills. I have a mentor and do connect with other developers and industry professionals during meetups on weekends.
