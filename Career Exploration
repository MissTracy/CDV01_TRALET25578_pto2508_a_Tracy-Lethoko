My experience in Java development and UX/UI design aligns well with both banking systems and startup environments where reliability and creativity are key. I’m recently drawn to Web3 and blockchain because they combine problem solving by building secure, decentralized solutions. Currently, I’m enrolled in two blockchain classes to deepen my understanding of smart contracts and the future of digital interactions.
