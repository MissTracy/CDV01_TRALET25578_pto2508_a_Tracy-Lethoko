### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):

   - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
   - Explain the rationale behind each goal.

   In the next 1–2 years, my goal is to finish my studies with CodeSpace and build a strong portfolio as a UI/UX designer or web developer. I’ll measure my progress by completing projects that showcase both my design and coding skills. This goal is achievable since I already have experience creating websites and enjoy designing logical, user-friendly interfaces. It’s relevant because it directly supports my passion for creating visually appealing, functional digital experiences. I aim to secure a full-time role in this field within two years of completing my program

2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):

   - Outline your long-term career aspirations.
   - Describe how these align with your interests and skills.

   In the next 3–5 years, my goal is to become a specialist in my field, whether in web or blockchain development and be recognized for my expertise. I also hope to give back by mentoring or teaching younger developers part-time, as I’m passionate about youth empowerment and knowledge sharing. Using the skills and experience I gain, I want to create sustainable tech solutions that support disadvantaged communities. This aligns with my interests in innovation, problem-solving, and making technology accessible to everyone.

### Part 4: Action Plan

1. **Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals**:

   - Detail specific actions or steps needed to achieve each short-term goal.
   - Include any resources or support required.

   Focus on completing my CodeSpace course and building a strong portfolio that showcases my front-end and UI/UX projects. I’ll continue improving my design and coding skills. I’ll network with industry professionals and apply for entry level roles. The main support I’ll need is from CodeSpace to recommend me to companies looking for web or entry level UI/UX developers where I’d be a good fit.

2. **Preparation for Long-term Goals**:

   - Describe the preparations or groundwork necessary for your long-term aspirations.
   - Consider additional skills, experiences, or qualifications needed.

   Complete my diploma in software development to strengthen my technical foundation and for formality. Continue developing my project aimed at helping disadvantaged students through technology. Keep learning and staying updated with the latest tools, frameworks, and industry trends. Gaining more experience in different areas of development will also help me discover my niche and specialize in it, helping me grow into a specialist and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.

### Part 5: Reflection on Challenges and Opportunities

1. **Anticipated Challenges**:

   - Identify potential obstacles or challenges in reaching your goals.
   - Consider strategies to overcome these challenges.

   Challenge I face is trying to do too many things at once and not always balancing my time well. To manage this, I’ll create a realistic work schedule to stay organized and meet deadlines. Another challenge is that I’m past the typical “youth” age group, which makes it harder to access certain internships and entry level opportunities. To overcome that, I’ll focus on building strong skills and a solid portfolio that helps me stand out based on ability, not age

2. **Opportunities for Growth**:

   - Highlight any opportunities you can leverage for career growth.
   - Include networking, mentorship, or educational opportunities.

   I study alot so I'm building strong technical skills. I have a mentor and do connect with other developers and industry professionals during meetups on weekends.
