Steps to Achieve Short-term Goals:

Focus on completing my CodeSpace course and building a strong portfolio that showcases my front-end and UI/UX projects. I’ll continue improving my design and coding skills. I’ll network with industry professionals and apply for entry level roles. The main support I’ll need is from CodeSpace to recommend me to companies looking for web or entry level UI/UX developers where I’d be a good fit.


Preparation for Long-term Goals:

Complete my diploma in software development to strengthen my technical foundation and for formality. Continue developing my project aimed at helping disadvantaged students through technology. Keep learning and staying updated with the latest tools, frameworks, and industry trends. Gaining more experience in different areas of development will also help me discover my niche and specialize in it, helping me grow into a specialist and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
